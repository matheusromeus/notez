balance was always a lie. and if you're not doing great in this unrealistic scale, it will change how you look at yourself. it makes you think that the different parts of you are in competition with each other. like all are battling for the same limited hours a day. life essentially becomes a zero sum game. you always feel like, when you do something, you should probably be doing something else instead. 

so the real question isn't how do I balance everything. the question is how do i see myself as a person with different expressions. how can i let different areas of my life feed each other instead of fight each other?

YOU HAVE TO GO DEEP INTO SOMETHING. YOU HAVE TO BE OBSESSIVE ABOUT SOMETHING.

Being the same all the time is very unnatural.

Be unreasonable. Be unbalanced. Give yourself permission to care about some things more in some "seasons".

Every season you go hard on something while keeping everything else at baseline. 

> You are just one person making decisions about where to put your energy right now. You are not choosing between gym or school. You are just choosing which class to sit in today.

and the first part of the solution is to reject balance.


everything is training. work in one area is work in every area. this is the polymath principle. 

let insights from one field inform your work in another. 

This is what psychologists call transfer, the way that skills and insights learned in one context show up in another. And it happens way more than we realize. Because the discipline you build from consistent training shows up in your work ethic. The focus you build from studying shows up in your ability to be present with people. The self-awareness you build from relationship shows up in how you manage your own psychology during hard times.

Every activity teaches way more than its first order lesson.

*The way you do something, is the way you do everything.*

What is this experience teaching me that applies elsewhere?
