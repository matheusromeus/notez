today i got defensive when my partner criticised me about not having enough money in savings. 

i was so on the edge and so easily triggered by small things. and at that time, she shouldve avoided that conversation or any topics like that.

she does know me. but maybe only on a certain subset.

i was silent because my mind knew that i was on the edge, distracted, triggered. and and i needed a reset until i came back to my self.
