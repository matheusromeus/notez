do it and show it. don't give advice. some things or behaviours irk me because i used to do it or i do the same thing. 

i wanna develop my coding craft. from scratch. build a systems level of thinking. 

i wanna be complex. i want to indulge with the complex. i want to be sophisticated. i want to take my tastes to a whole different level.

read books
explore your own taste in music

	why did i not enjoy the trip.. because they were not my gang. but i wasnt even that happy that rithika was there. i feel like im settling down. like i was not excited to go to the trip even though she was there. wow. is it the anhedonia? or am i making myself believe that i love her. 

	i thought my mind was distracted. but no. it wants to run. and i'm forcing it to stop and smell the flowers when my destination is a garden. or maybe i think it's a garden at the end of all of this. and me trying to enjoy or giving into pleasure is because of that faint thought of 'what if there is no garden at the end of this?' 

be unapologetically you. let go. of your mind and your body. submit it to your intuitions. that primal instinct.

5 months have been a blur. and i dont know if its a good thing or a bad thing.
