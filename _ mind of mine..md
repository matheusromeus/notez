	i thought my mind was distracted. but no. it wants to run. and i'm forcing it to stop and smell the flowers when my destination is a garden. or maybe i think it's a garden at the end of all of this. and me trying to enjoy or giving into pleasure is because of that faint thought of 'what if there is no garden at the end of this?'. until it reaches where it belongs. it will be disturbed.
