Flair becomes inefficiency, risk becomes liability, and the unpredictable is systematically ironed out. 

Just as football once had space for flamboyant outliers and now rewards system players who obey structure.



Systems suppress, but they can’t fully erase. The trick is to know when to bend into the system and when to rupture it.


The constant is adaptation. Understanding the cycles—when the world rewards structure versus unpredictability—lets you place yourself where rarity equals leverage.

THE BIGGER QUESTIONS.

Why do societies, systems, and cultures swing between valuing creativity and efficiency, individuality and conformity? 

What is currently “out of favor” that might become leverage tomorrow? Systems always bury inefficiencies that become assets under new constraints.

Anything judged permanent in value is an illusion. Probe into what drives these normative shifts: power structures, collective attention, resource distribution, or technological evolution.




The big oscillations in life (macro) are not isolated. They are influenced by other micro dynamics like human psychology, socio-economic factors etc. 



the system suppresses deviations to preserve stability. but if deviations are an inefficiency why do people like some of them? because they're good. only the good deviations are liked. i guess. People respond to what breaks monotony, signals competence beyond measured efficiency, or offers a new solution.

a shift happens when the system becomes brittle. because now it has to shift the other way. 

Inefficiency becomes potential when the system that penalized it reaches a limit—when over-optimization, uniformity, or rigidity creates gaps. A rigid process fails to handle variability. Can't adapt to external changes. it becomes valuable precisely when the system’s optimization exposes gaps only that inefficiency can fill. it becomes potential because it interacts with the system in a way the system cannot absorb or counter efficiently

a system that is geared for the predictable, when hit by an unpredictable, carries high leverage. and that inefficiency done by the unpredictable person became potential or valuable.

it was an "inefficiency" only in the eyes of the new rules. that shows how things are not intrinsically good or bad, but contextually.
