programming is not theory. it is the execution. 

math is the theory. physics is an application. and programming is the execution.

Mathematics is abstract structure.
Physics is the model of reality using that structure.
Programming is the operationalization—turning models into executable systems.

math - a study of structure. whichever discipline requires structure, requires math.

subjects were made for us to understand the world around us. and if i took an inspiration out of it, and then if math also took inspiration from it, both will be present in both worlds.
