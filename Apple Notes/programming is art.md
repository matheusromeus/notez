programming is art?

books written by an ai can easily be figured out. but not code. why?

are we looking only at 'whether it works'?

what about the style? what about the programming language? what about the process? 

what about the novel writers who get joy out of just writing?

maybe it's time that we stepped back and revisit why we write code.

an art in its highest level requires mastery. and you reach there only through devotion, obsession and repetition.

look at famous painters. look at famous writers, musicians. everyone had their own signature style.
