early waking, early sleeping place. i like it. i feel like i would be a lot more healthier here. you have to walk a lot of inclines, just walk a lot, and maybe get a north eastern girl too. 

i shouldn't have come for this. i feel like i am running away or hiding from it all.

what am i trying to see when i go to a new place? what am i looking for? i feel like i didn't see anything here. i am too stuck in my head to appreciate what's outside.

and the trip has just started.
