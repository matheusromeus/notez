- client hits server with login creds
- if validated, then the server sends an access token and a refresh token.
- access token is sent back on every subsequent requests
- but refresh token is only sent at a certain endpoint (just a security feature)
- when access token expires, the server sends back a 401 unauthorised and accesstokenexpired error.
- then, we hit the /refresh endpoint with the refresh token and new access token is sent back
- after many days, when refresh token is expired just like the AT, the user has to sign in again
