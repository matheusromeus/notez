latency- delay in first response
throughput- operations per time unit

balance trade offs in sd
scalability & consistency


CAP Theorem
consistency- all nodes display identical data, reads will always be the latest write

availability- every request receives a response 

partition tolerance- the system continues to operate despite network failures b/w nodes

cap theorem states only 2 can be achieved at max. 

load balancer algorithms

caching, cdn for static media

maintaining data consistency, cache invalidation strategies, cache eviction policies, 

sql scales vertically, nosql scales horizontally

sql when we need financial apps, acid compliance and structured consistent data.

nosql when large volumes of unstructured data, rapid dev, flexibility in data structure


database query performance - database indexes (fast reads but writing gets slow) ,

data partitioning - horizontal partitioning(sharding) rows of table are put in different dbs , vertical (cols are put in different dbs) ,
