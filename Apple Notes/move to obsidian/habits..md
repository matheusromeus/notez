habits.

the master is your conscious mind and the servant is the subconscious. even though the latter is more powerful.

it believes everything you say. leo last dialogue.

try to find more about the power and programming of the subconscious mind.

you are a god. and the programming you were a part of is to shackle you. religion, societal structures.

but isn't this what satan promised us? that you can be truly "free" from everything? i think these people aren't talking about being free or above god, just free enough to be the highest version of you

"everything can be changed". if not you were programmed the wrong way.
