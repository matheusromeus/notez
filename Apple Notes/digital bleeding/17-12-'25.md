you are being selfish. you are putting immense pressure on a young girl by asking her to be your ride or die. first of all, you haven't earned the right to even ask her that. you are letting your fears get the better of you and ruining what you already have. 

you have to take more care of her. you are again the reason for her to cry. and she got a small panic attack too. please be more careful of her.. she's your baby.. please..
