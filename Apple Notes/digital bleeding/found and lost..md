i've let everything find me in life. maybe because i felt like these were what i truly deserved. and those that found would always have a special place in my heart. there's something serendipitous/romantic about letting something find you through all the noise. but something struck me when i turned 23. i became more interested in learning to discern the noise so that i can find everything that lied on the other side. my true paradise. i spent days and months decoding the neatly arranged mess. call me greedy, but i would call this making your own luck. i believe too much in destiny and fate to truly overcome this, but the pain of a thousand lives not lived cannot be explained to a non fantasiser.
