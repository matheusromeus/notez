i need to learn to control my impulses. but is it truly possible unless you have danced in the depth with your devils?

is it possible to stay controlled of a bad habit from the get go?

why do i feel like i have to control a habit? because it is bad. 

every habit didn't start off as a bad habit. and every habit is bad if you do too much of it too.
