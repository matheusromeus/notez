the truth is.. i have been struggling. with small things and big things equally in life and with my coping methods too. 

it's overwhelming.

with my feelings; feeling like i can work harder, but not even able to work hard. 

with my tech addiction, but this is because i feel like i could be working even hard.

and time is running out fast, parents are getting old. 

struggling with waking up. struggling with going to sleep. getting a workout done. trouble focusing. 

i get a lot of thoughts, but the moment i sit in front of a paper to write, i go blank.

feeling like the job is taking away most of the time for the day, and sometimes small tasks take more than 8 hours!?!

i have to be mindful of my consumption. focus more on creating. whether thoughts or things.

i feel like i am not meant to be a coder. i cant focus for long times. i am struggling with basic focus and tasks.

am i burned out? already? everything is overwhelming me. 

im waiting for something, anything and everything to just get over with. but this has to be sustainable, i dont want to be in a rut. 

i want to eliminate most of the things happening in life. why? even having a lot of apps in my phone is troubling me.
