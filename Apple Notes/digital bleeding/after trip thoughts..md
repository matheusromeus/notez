i wanna meet new people to test out my own limits and motivate me to upgrade myself.

i want to go on more treks, learn fighting, get a gun license and be dangerous. want to be in peak physical condition.

should go on no-contact trips at least once a year. for a week or something.

what is a solo trip all about? are you trying to find peace in yourself? can you entertain yourself? what should i have been looking for? is it more than just a beautiful view? more than just a passing fancy?

the Dzukou valley trek taught me more about life than a single book. 

should go swimming at least once a week. Sundays.

my body is pretty tolerant to cold conditions.

i love driving.

mountain peaks, stars, things that are much bigger than us and overwhelm us, that's what i am interested in.

sleeping bag, good gloves for driving and staying warm in the cold, good trekking shoes, apple watch ultra?, what watches do trekkers use? good running shoes.

watch trekking and climbing videos on youtube and reddit
