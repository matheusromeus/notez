I couldn’t. I felt like I didn’t belong. Tbh I didn’t wanna be a mass consumer. And I wasn’t good enough at anything, or pretty enough. I have felt out of place for a long time. Only times I’ve felt at peace is when I sit alone with some dope music.

I’m poor, I’m losing my hair. I don’t like socialising, and I feel lonely. Even with allll this love outside me, I’ve got nothing inside.

just writing about what i love, makes me smile.
