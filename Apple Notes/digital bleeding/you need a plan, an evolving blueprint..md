you need a plan, an evolving blueprint. 

you lack for approval, because you feel like your survival is in their hands.

all habits aren't bad unless they prevent you from achieving your goals. and mind you, different people have different goals. 

if there is no low, there is no creativity

look at aspects of your life and what you want to change or dont like, thats your problem and how you reach there is the plan. 

maybe i am afraid of change because it requires creating a new identity. and that is scary to let go of whatever you were.

you havent become the person that would do these things or habits

discipline is a feature of identity

the rich, the successful have programmed their own video game that is addictive, enjoyable and provides a logical sequence of steps that results in experience. it helps them understand what is worth paying attention to and what is not. it is a framework of mind that dispels chaos or entropy.

you start building your own world by laying foundations of your new identity

your picture for the life you despise

"a goal is a tool for identifying a problem"

trial and error is your best friend

constraints breed creativity

you need projects to apply your ideas to

skills are useless in isolation
