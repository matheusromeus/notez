i have no one that i miss. i don't love anything. i don't love anybody. the things i want to do, i don't do it for the right reasons. i feel like i'm putting a show for people. even after yesterday, i took my parents to a good place paid the bill, even then i feel alone, unloved and fake.


i need a new identity. a new life. new friends. new town.
