a deliberate approach to building a unique combination of skills that compounds in value over time.

Today's most interesting opportunities exist at the intersections - where different domains collide and create new possibilities.

the ability to synthesise insights across domains becomes more valuable than narrow expertise. It's about building a career that compounds in interesting ways rather than just accumulating years of similar experience.

A high-leverage generalist, on the other hand, is like a powerful meta-algorithm that can adapt to entirely new classes of problems.

But modern work is messier, more fluid, and increasingly interdisciplinary.


- Spot patterns across seemingly unrelated domains.
- Identify novel solutions by combining existing ideas.
- Navigate ambiguity and adapt to changing conditions.
- Bridge communication gaps between different teams.

they require synthesising insights across disciplines - understanding technical constraints, user psychology, business models, and organisational dynamics all at once.

While specialists often get trapped in domain-specific thinking patterns, generalists develop powerful learning capabilities that accelerate learning in any new field.

When you understand game theory from economics, you suddenly have new mental models for understanding everything from API design to organisational incentives.

Each new domain you explore doesn't just add to your knowledge linearly - it multiplies your ability to:
- Recognise fundamental patterns that show up across different systems.
- Transfer problem-solving strategies from one domain to another.
- Learn new technologies faster by mapping them to familiar concepts.
- See second-order effects that specialists often miss.
