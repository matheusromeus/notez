today. i truly felt alone. now i know why my shoulders hang low. the weight. the heaviness. mom and dad are the only ones i can call close now. there's nobody in my phone book that i would call if something was to happen. nobody that I would give my life for. my brain tells me to go be the best version of yourself. to master everything. but my heart yearns to love. anything. anyone. my self esteem and confidence are at an all time low. i'm losing my looks. i leave everything half way, career is looking bleak... idk where it is from, but somewhere a sliver of hope in me exists. and that is what's keeping me alive and kicking. and maybe that's all i need. but i should stop waiting around for something to be handed out to me. nothing was handed out to me. none. i wanted a big family, a group of brothers, to be born with a silver spoon, but i was not given anything that i really wanted. all god gave was myself and the potential that i saw in me. and he said go, get whatever you want.
