if everyone was loved the right amount, they wouldn't go searching for anything else. 

it's the absence of love that moves the world forward but it's the presence of love that makes it go round.

should i try to find someone that would love me unconditionally or be okay with knowing that nobody can ever love another person like they do themselves
