i'm not interested in other people's life. like what you like, what you did the other day. bro idgaf. that's why it's hard for me to connect to other people and cultivate good relationships.

... the truth is that i feel bad about it. humans are supposed to be social animals. and i am blessed with people that care about me and i am throwing it all away.
