none of the memories came flooding back in. no regrets or guilt of what could’ve been took over me. i felt like i had been cherry picked and put back into the time we were in meltwater. 

i don’t think i’ve ever loved you. i always wanted to take care of you, to protect you from the bad things. is that love?

i could never be the man i was supposed to be when I was with you. And that’ll haunt me for the rest of my life. 

maybe in another life.
