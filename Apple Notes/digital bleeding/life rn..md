i haven’t got the chance to contemplate life in a while. in a way, i feel like i have been avoiding it. why? beats me. i don’t feel ready for anything of the things that i have been given to me right now. i want to romanticise life more. i want to enjoy whatever i do and take my sweet time with it. my vocabulary and language has taken a dip. my brain is overstimulated and becoming more dumber each day. i have become a passerby to my own emotions and events happening in my life. i am acting like a man with no vision, no values, no self discipline or love. you are losing the entire continuity and context of life and every small thing you are doing. because your mind is filled with junk. 

slow down. intention. control. choose real > fake. 

have an intention behind everything you do. mean it.

i dont like social media. 

everything has become so desensitised. talking to someone, seeing their life updates. asking someone how they have been. listening to them. i am such an old school at heart.
