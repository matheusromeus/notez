Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear 
and with misty eyes I take this photo,
to fossil a feeling I’m 
afraid might disappear…

“Today of all days you deserve these roses” 
the excitement with which I narrated,
“Oh! the magic this boy encloses!”

“all sunflowers will always remind me of you”
the first time I thought the butterflies just might be the preview  

“so, no guavas?” 
I say with utmost conviction 
only to catch a glimpse of your smile
in the reflection 

“Let me get the jasmine from the top”
the yellow swing then saw some rain showers that didn’t stop…

At a risk of being sappy, 
Kevs, here are a few things which made me 
undeniably happy! 

when you rest your chin on my shoulder
Plant a soft kiss when I’m hiding under your arms, 
it melts away the weight of a boulder 

when you compliment me using the same 
words my mother does 
decipher my wants from the jargon, the
red strings play a loud audible 
electric fuzz 

the disfigured hair tie I still retain,
to remind me of a beautiful windy day
with warm pancakes and the memories that remained

the letter you wrote, 
I read in the dimly lit plane, 
with each word I stopped, 
to soak the ink in 

I wondered if anyone could hear my heart beat faster,
tears swelling up, I wished in that moment 
we were warm in bed soaked with laughter 

Kevs, 

I only ever hope that beautiful things happen to you, 
and even when I knew all along,
I hope you can see that all your dreams
will come true. 

and while I may have to remember 
the map of your veins for longer 
than my fingers intended 
I find solace in knowing
the bookshelf I built for our stories is only getting stronger.
