"Hey amnesiac!" Came a call from a face he'd never forget easily.
 
I still remember that day. That day, the sky was shining multicolored like her converse sneakers. 
"One day, if you wake up and forget my face, 
What will I do?"
. 
If I were what you called me, you wouldn't have been still here.. While I tossed and turned in my bed at 2 am trying to get you out of my pen. 
- To the girl who taught me love.. I started. "No! I've got to stop writing about you.." I reassured myself. 
But this was the only way to save our dying memories inside me.

I still remember that day, 
That day, even the skies cried. 

" Not even for one second, dare you forget that I love you", she chided the poor amnesiac... 

But one thing you didn't realize. It wasn't me, it was you who was the real amnesiac. You forgot what happened between us, you forgot how you felt when you ran your hands through my hair, you forgot our first everything.. You forgot us.

And now all this poor amnesiac has are her memories which he prays he'll forget like his others too. As he wrote this, the pen ran out of ink, never to be filled again.
