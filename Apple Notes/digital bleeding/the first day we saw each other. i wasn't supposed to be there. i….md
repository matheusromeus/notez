the first day we saw each other. i wasn't supposed to be there. i had been there a million times, but i saw you only then. 

then i saw you, sweaty, playing basketball. i had never seen that cute a girl playing basketball. and you were good too!

i tried keeping my cool. 

it was love at first sight. but we never told each other. 

the first time we texted, me texting in the shower. waiting for your every reply

met your parents

i forgot my past loves. and i fell deep.
