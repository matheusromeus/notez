what value are you providing?

you haven't received any unfair advantage than yourself. so it might be harder, it might take longer.

find THAT community. 

what makes a piece of content good? is there best content? or is it all relative?

authenticity

being an expert is overrated, just be you in public.

posting should be the downstream of doing

you can't expect an algorithm to give you content, you have to actively scour for it and nurture it.

if you dont have a goal, you dont have a plan, and then you dont know what to do, so you let someone else dictate it for you

most people want things fed to them and then they complain.

trust, taste, high standards.

intelligence is a poor quality in isolation. without agency, vision, taste, it's useless.

you don't get because you don't give. you are not happy because you are not giving value.

what is your resume? what does it convey? how can you convey this in other ways?
