here, listen my beautiful sunflower. i want you to know how pretty, hot and beautiful you are.. and you are feeling insecure about how you look, but you are literally the only woman i have dated who is equally beautiful from the inside and outside. i have seen you in the morning having not taken a bath not brushed and i still thought you were the cutest piece of shit i had ever seen. i am not even kidding when i tell you that i dont even look at all those instagram models like i used to before. you are the most prettiest girl in the world. your chubby cheeks, the belly you don't like, your curves, your eyes.. god i just could eat you up my cupcake, i live every single body part of yours. never, ever tell yourself you are not pretty or beautiful, ill come and punch tf outta you. i know you feel imperfect but trust me when i tell you, you are perfect for me. i had never posted my exes on instagram before, i am the most proud to be seen with you and holding your hand. and even when you feel ugly, i would still find ways to prove you wrong.
