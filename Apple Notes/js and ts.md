work or health?

i need to read open source code on github, for next js and tech stack i use. tutorials don't teach you flair. 

js definitive guide, tapascript jd - finish these for javascript. then can move to leetcode and codechef and codeforces.

on the side learn rust, go whatever you are interested in but don't be driven by them.

you need to learn and master full stack javascript and typescript in like 3 months.

use ai less, do it slow but do it deliberately. do it with conviction. dont be passive in what you want.
