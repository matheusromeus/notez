- quickly build **stable** products and ship features **fast**. 

- a good issue, project tracker that does not take too much time for devs.

- github should be good source of data about the work done, progress and if people are writing maintainable code.

- nothing else matters if you are not releasing the products, because there is no feedback loop to know what we did was right or wrong.

- take time to plan sprints. plan the tech architecture first, and then list out all the features that will be implemented for that particular phase. it should not change. everything else added to the next phase.

- for implementing the first point, there has to be a **unified** foolproof and proven process. and document that too. this helps the devs to jump between projects.

- one lead, one designer, one frontend, one backend = a perfect team
