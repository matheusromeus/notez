Write a short and *obviously personalised* cover letter


transparency -  public roadmap (what prakash is planning, note it down, note the timeline) , public discussions, ownership, 

write things down, PRs, Issues, public comms channels

reduce standups to maybe twice or thrice

people should have the context of whats going on in every second

- Issues in GitHub that explain thinking, include feature requests, or have problems or bugs

- How last sprint went
- What the plan is for the next sprint

how can we help everyone adopt a maker's schedule?


- excessive cost
- scaling challenges
- customer needs 

check what others are using
choose and test

lack of maturity


github as public proof of work
