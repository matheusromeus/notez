sub agents go and find the stuff in a new context window and sends back a really really succinct message to the parent agent.

sub agents are for managing context

stay in the smart zone 40% of context window

research 
- understand how your system/codebase works
- find all the relevant files
- stay with the objective no bug hunting

plan 
- outline the exact implementation steps
- include filenames, lines and snippets
- be explicit about how we are gonna test it

DO NOT OUTSOURCE THE THINKING, AI CANNOT THINK, IT CAN ONLY BE AMPLIFIED BY IT.

agents need to be onboarded. like the memento movie.

Research = Compression of Truth


Every piece of technology, the valuable ones, arrived so that we can solve higher problems, problems with the highest leverage. And that is how humanity has worked in the past.
