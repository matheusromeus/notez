if what youre building is not straightforward, look outside your industry. Look at how they build trust, explain risks, and guide users through complex flows.

be explicit about your goals. write it in a sentence or two. and turn that into a question. how can we do that. 

edge cases. always ask what might a user do? what could go wrong? what happens to the next and previous steps?

If you're not a designer, but you need to get things over the line, focus on usability, not novelty. A clean, obvious user flow beats an original, but confusing one every time.

why would you create your own language model? don't reinvent the wheel.
