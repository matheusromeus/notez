i hated math. with all my soul. 

so in a structure, math can find the patterns. what the patterns roll out to, relationship between different elements in a structure, with what constraints the whole structure was made or what the elements were made with, logic can define with all these rules inside the structure, what is possible, form is the entire structure stripped off its bare minimals right?

so whatever i said was within a structure. these are meta structural properties
