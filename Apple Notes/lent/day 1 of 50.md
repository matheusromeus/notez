sleeping is still an issue. i keep waking up in the middle of the night.

life right now feels like something i am totally unprepared for. like i was thrown into the deep end. and tbh it is sucking away a lot of the fun out of life. aimlessly wandering through life even though i may have potential. and to see it slowly fade away... only if you had a mentor. i am allowed to make a lot of mistakes, which is a good thing, but the rate of learning i would've liked is nowhere near.

to have nothing to look forward to is a very unhappy state to be in. the only thing keeping me going is self-improvement. to be better, to gain more knowledge, to be better equipped to take care of my loved ones.

and ALL of this would've been okay, if I had more time. more time with my parents, more time with myself.
