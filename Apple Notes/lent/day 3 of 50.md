why don't I try appearing for the CSEs? i have a total of 6 attempts left, and 6 more years to be ineligible. in 6 years whether i try or not i will be 32. and make dad and mom proud.

going on a non-veg abstinence will force me to eat all the meals in a day, otherwise i might lose a lot weight and fall sick.
