sorry for the clickbait. this has nothing to do with layouts, shapes or pixels on a screen. my definition of a designer is someone who gets what he wants. tbh, we all are designers in our own ways. how we choose to live our lives, the partners we choose, the job, everything a formulation of decisions we carefully chose to design our life. 

being a designer = being a problem hunter + problem solver.

now let's talk about pixels on a screen. what are the incentives behind every decision that the traditional designers take? underneath all the aesthetics and pretty pixels, they are all solving a pain point of the user base. every shape, every animation is done to solve a problem. if not, then it's fundamentally bad design.

now how can we be a great designer. start  by solving your own problems. and if you don't have any, take a break, touch grass, do nothing, let your thoughts marinate. slowly you'll start noticing things that you never have. inside and outside. sometimes the best way to solve a problem is by taking a step back. (more on this in complex systems)

it can simply be designing a routine for yourself (trust me, it's not as simple as it sounds). or understanding your body and creating a diet plan. each activity requires careful design. and the only way you can become a great designer is by doing this everyday. make problem solving your second nature. do it so many times, fail too many times. let weird, unconventional ideas spring out of you. life is like a system design interview, there are only trade-offs.
